autotools examples
------------------

I am working on an autotools based project now and am having some trouble
finding good tutorials on how to set up projects. My goals here are to create a
sequence of increasingly complex autotools projects that:
1. are portable
2. make minimal use of make and, instead, rely heavily on automake
3. make minimal use of shell scripts or m4 written by hand
4. avoid recursive make: everything should be in =configure.ac= or =Makefile.am=
   in the top directory.


automake and libtool can handle most of the hard stuff, but I have not found
good examples of complicated setups.

The goal is to ultimately write a tutorial that shows how to do the following:
1. compile multiple libraries (via libtool) which may link to eachother
2. manage multiple external dependencies, each of which may be versioned
3. compile multiple executables (tutorial programs)
4. compile and run a test suite (with the provided autotools test harness)
